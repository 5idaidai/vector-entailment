\section{Reasoning with natural language quantifiers and negation}\label{sec:quantifiers}

% TODO: Compress?

We have seen that recursive NNs can learn an approximation of propositional
logic.  However, natural languages can express functional meanings of
considerably greater complexity than this.  As a first step towards
investigating whether our models can capture this complexity, we now
attempt to directly measure the degree to which they are able to
develop suitable representations for the semantics of natural language
quantifiers like \ii{some} and \ii{all}. Quantification is far from
the only place in natural language where complex functional meanings
are found, but it is a natural starting point, since it can be tested
in sentences whose structures are otherwise quite simple, and since it
has formed a standard case study in prior formal work on natural
language inference \cite{Icard:Moss:2013:LILT}.

\paragraph{Experiments}
Our experimental data consist of pairs of sentences generated from a
small artificial grammar. Each sentence contains a quantifier, a noun
which may be negated, and an intransitive verb which may be
negated. We use the basic quantifiers \ii{some}, \ii{most}, \ii{all},
\ii{two}, and \ii{three}, and their negations \ii{no}, \ii{not-all},
\ii{not-most}, \ii{less-than-two}, and \ii{less-than-three}. We also
include five nouns, four intransitive verbs, and the negation symbol
\ii{not}. In order to be able to define relations between sentences
with differing lexical items, we define the lexical relations between
each noun--noun pair, each verb--verb pair, and each
quantifier--quantifier pair. The grammar accepts aligned pairs of
sentences of this form and calculates the natural logic relationship
between them.  Some examples of these data are provided in (\ref{p1}--\ref{p3}) below.
  As in previous sections, the goal of
learning is then to assign these relational labels accurately to
unseen pairs of sentences.

%nouns = ['warthogs', 'turtles', 'mammals', 'reptiles', 'pets']
%verbs = ['walk', 'move', 'swim', 'growl']
%dets = ['all', 'not_all', 'some', 'no', 'most', 'not_most', 'two', 'lt_two', 'three', 'lt_three']
%adverbs = ['', 'not']

% To assign relation labels to sentence pairs, we built a small
% task-specific implemenation of MacCartney's logic that can
% accurately label sentences of this restricted language. The logic is
% not able to derive all intuitively true relations of this language,
% and fails to derive a single unique relation for certain types of
% statement, including De Morgean's laws (e.g. \ii{(all pets) growl
% $\natneg$ (some pet) (not growl)}), and we simply discard these
% examples. Exhaustively generating the valid sentences under this
% grammar and choosing those to which a relation label can be assigned
% yields 66k sentence pairs. Some examples of these data are provided
% in Table~\ref{examplesofdata}.

% TODO: Rewrite experimental setup.
We evaluate the models by randomly sampling 20\% of the data to
test on and training on the remainder. In this setting, the models are being asked to learn a
complete reasoning system for the limited language and logic presented
in the training data, but it is not being asked to generalize to test
examples that are substantially different from those it was trained
on. Crucially, though, to succeed on this task, the models must be able
to recognize all of the lexical relations between the nouns, verbs,
and quantifiers and how they interact. For instance, it might see
\eqref{p1} and \eqref{p2} in training and, from that information,
determine \eqref{p3}.

\paragraph{Results} The results, reported in Figure \ref{qresultstable}, show that both models are able to learn to generalize the underlying logic well.
