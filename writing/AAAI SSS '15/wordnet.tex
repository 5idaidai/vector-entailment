% TODO: Fill out

% Can a model to do this with something that has the scale and structure of a real vocabulary?

% Wordnet! Subsumption lattice for words!

% Three relations: Hyper, hypo, coordinate
% Explain extraction and rationale for each

% Data creation:
% - Enumerate filtering strategy

% Experiment:
% - Explain train test split

% Reults:
% RNN / RNTN x Data volume x Accuracy vs. MacroF1
